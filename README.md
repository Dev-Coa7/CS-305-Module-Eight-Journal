# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company, required solutions for encrypting long-term archive files and addressing software vulnerabilities. The goal was to enhance security, ensure regulatory compliance, and protect sensitive financial data.

# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I effectively identified and addressed vulnerabilities, including implementing AES for encryption and SHA-256 for data integrity. Coding securely protects sensitive information, ensures regulatory compliance, and builds trust with clients and stakeholders.

# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The vulnerability assessment process was challenging but helpful, showing me the importance of secure key management.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I added layers of security by incorporating SHA-256 for hashing, validating inputs, and addressing vulnerable dependencies. In the future, tools like OWASP Dependency-Check would help assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I tested the application after refactoring to ensure that security improvements did not compromise functionality. Static and dynamic testing validated that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used AES for encryption, SHA-256 for hashing, and dependency-check tools to enhance security. 

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
This project demonstrates my ability to identify vulnerabilities, implement secure coding practices, and enhance application security. It also highlights my skills in balancing functionality with security.
